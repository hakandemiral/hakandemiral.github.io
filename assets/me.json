    "aboutMe" : "I'm Hakan, since the day I was born, I have created myself by producing something. I have not been educated in any formal education institution, I believe that I can educate myself more effectively. I'm actively working on front-end technologies, the incredible rise of javascript in the last period and the fact that it can work wonders without realizing the platform is the main reason I work with javascript. I am excited to produce a new generation of solutions without the cumbersome traditional technologies.",
